This repository contains both a repository for clients aswell as tools, devtools and installers for them.
These parts al have separate uses and thus also different needs for licenses. Because of this every part of this repository falls under different agreements while this one more or less exists as an overall agreement.
Note that if a part dosen't have a license-file present in it's folder, it automaticly falls under this one.

Another thing thats necessary with the nature of this project is that different versions or revisions should be able to have different agreements and licenses.
Altho I still have the full ability to change/switch or even remove license aggrements from a part of the project or the project as a whole.
However if you download anything from the repository or a release/official-ditribution of this repository or any part of it, the license agreement currently included with your download will still comply for that version, even if it's changed in the future.
As an example if you download a part of the project with no license/agreement made or connected to it, your download will still not fall under any license if I would add one in later.
NOTE! If you would download the same part again or an asset from/to it that at the new time of download, falls under a license said license would then apply to the downloaded parts.

By downloading any part or asset of this repository you agree to read and comply with the license given and connected at the time of download, and agknowledge that I may change the license of said part without informing or saying anything before hand.
You also agknowledge that I may remove this part of the license agrement at any time altho old or previously downloaded assets will still be under the license given at the time of download.
