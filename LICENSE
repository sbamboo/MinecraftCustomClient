No license is provided at this time, this project is in development so please dont reditribute any files without my permission.

This repository contains both a repository for clients aswell as tools, devtools and installers for them.
Theese parts al have separate uses and thus also diffrent needs for licenses. Because of this every part of this repo falls under diffrent aggrements while this one more or less exists as an overall agreement.
Note that if a part dosen't have a license file present in it's folder, it automaticly falls under this one.

Another thing thats neceseary since the nature of this project is that diffrent versions or revisions should be able to have diffrent aggrements and licenses.
This means that I remain to have the full ability to change/switch or even remove license aggrements from a part of the project or the project as a whole.
However if you download anything from the repository or a release/(official)ditribution of this repo or any part of it, the license aggrement currently included with your download will still comply for that version.
As an example if you download a part of the project with no license/aggrement made or connected to it, yout download will still not fall under any license if I would add one in.
NOTE! If you would download the same part again or an asset from/to it that at the new time of download, falls under a license that license will apply to the downloaded parts.

By downloading any part or asset of this repository you agree to read and comply with the license given and connected at the time of download, and agknowlege that I may change the license of said part without informing or saying anything before hand.
You also agknowlege that I may remove this part of the license agrement at any time altho old or previously downloaded assets will still be under the license given at the time of download.
