- Add tool to rebuild al clients:
  1. list
  2. get sources
  3. iterate and unpack, replace source and rebuild
  ^ with option to backup last builds incase error, then auto re-replace if one failed.

- Update the data-copy tool to be more usefull and make an auto-migration tool.

- modrinth profile.json file support in compiler, so it can fetch mods from there.

- support for adding "mod" info like source-link and icon-link through compile.yml, this to backup the website support for showing a mods list.
  ofc, source-link can be retrived from listing for non-base64 entries, but this fills in the gap.
  icons can be auto-retrived from source based on listing-entry-type but once-agai fill-in and backup.

- Fix exe-signing: https://gist.github.com/PaulCreusy/7fade8d5a8026f2228a97d31343b335e

- Add a new option to uninstall old modpacks by looking in the directories:
  * installs/minecraft-custom-client/custom
  * installs/minecraft-custom-client/profile
  And the legacyRepo for names.
  (See the legacy installer code)

- Make main installer have a mainLoop so menus can have a "back" action instead of "exit", and error handling can return to lastMenu.

- Wrapp in try-catch with switch for errorType, and if permError show msg to start as elevated with examples for lnx "sudo <python> <path-to-file>" or win "..."

- fix in build that json,subprocess&getpass is getting pip:ed wrongly should be tex pyjson
