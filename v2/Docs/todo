support for adding "mod" info like source-link and icon-link through compile.yml, this for future website support for showing a mods list.
ofc, source-link can be retrived from listing for non-base64 entries, but this fills in the gap.
icons can be auto-retrived from source based on listing-entry-type but once-agai fill-in and backup.
