Installers:
  Modrinth support:
    The installers supports installing to modrinth using the --rinth and -rinthInstanceP,
    first time starting might fail since the installer dosen't install the correct dependencies at this time.
    Thus either start the main version with modrinth before or change the fabric version to smth else and then back again from inside modrinth.
